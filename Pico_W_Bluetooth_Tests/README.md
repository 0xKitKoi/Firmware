This is an attempt to make Michael Reevee's laser turret wireless. 
This setup uses two Pico W's. One is connected to my computer and takes input.
The Second Pico W controls the turret, lets say that circuit is across the room.
The Central.py would take input over serial and has set commands.
\X44Y180 would send the servos to X: 44, Y: 180
